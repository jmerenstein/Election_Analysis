# Election Analysis

## Overview Election Audit
The goal of this election analyis was to send data to the election comission so that they could complete their audit. The information that utulized Python to analyze and send over to the commission was the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. 

## Results:

## Election Audit Summary
The script that we wrote for this election can be used for any future or previous elections that the commission would like to audit. For example, if the comission wanted to see how people voted for the major polictical parties and that was in the dataset, then they could adjust the analysis to count the rows for the political parties and calculate what percentage voted for each party. To take that a step further the comission could also look at how people voted for political parties in the different counties. These are just two of many examples of how the script used here can be used to analyze different types of election data.
